# Quiz-Application

This was an early Javascript and Jquery application I built at the start of my learning experience. It is currently being used to test new hire compotency at Fitguard Inc.



This is a scaleable quiz application that can be used to determine the compotency of installation new hires. 
It can be changed to test other things by changing:
1. The H1 and logo elements in the header
2. The background image
3. Changing out the questions, potential answers and answers in store.js 

Programming utilized: 
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Jquery
